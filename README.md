# UWB Localization

This project gathers all code connected to the UWB Localization first introduced in [this](An%20EKF-SLAM%20based%20Ultra%20Wideband%20Localization%20Approach%20for%20Unknown%20Anchor%20Distributions.pdf) master thesis.
It is structured in two parts:
1. The [embedded code](embedded_uwb/) running on the SKITH UWB boards.
2. The [code](robot/) running on the robot including the UWB Localization EKF.
